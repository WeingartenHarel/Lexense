Planing steps:  
-first create the platfrom , html js and css files for the project
-next create a stage , container for the game
-create an example div with image of a bug
-create a function createBug and locate bug randomly, this function will be called every X seaconds
-function to move the bug ( the 'node' from the function creare bug), this function will reandomly choose to increace or decreace 
the value of top and left of each node every seacond
-create a click event for each node ('bug') that will remove the node and update point plus 1
create a function update points , POINTS = POINTS +1
ceate a function the count one minuet to end game ,
this function will present an overlay on top of the original stage to present end game.
handle responsive with css query and js if needed

- if I had more time, I would convert the code to react,
and make sure that the game is memory optimal, clear all time interval and set time out.
Also I would give more time for design , like sounds and animated gifs and try to make
 the movment of the bug more natural.
